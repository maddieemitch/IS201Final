    </h4>
    <img id = "family" src="images/family.JPG">
    <h4>This is my family! There are six of us, and I love them dearly. First is my dad, Max. He is a Nurse Practioner and has taught me everything I need to know about hunting, fishing, and loving every day. Next is my mom, Lana. She is a Speech Language Pathologist and is my hero. She is the kindest human I've ever met and definitely my best friend. Then there's me! I am the oldest and I have three little brothers. Max is 18, about to graduate high school and go on a mission. Then there's Will who is 14 and a total stud. Last is Josh who is 9, almost 10. He's a firecracker and definitely completes our family. </h4>
    <br>
    <img id = "horses" src="images/horses.jpg">
    <h4>One fun thing about me is I love horses. I have been riding every since I was little and it's something I truly love. There is something really special about horses. They relieve stress, reduce sadness, and calm your mind and heart. I've been able to go on many adventures on horses. One of my favorites is up at our cabin which is the picture above.</h4>
 
    <img id = "banff" src="images/banff.jpeg">
    <h4>This is a picture of Moraine Lake in Banff National Park, Canada! In 2019 my family and I went on a road trip 
        up the coast and went to Banff! This was definitely my favorite lake, the water looked like gatorade! What I would have given to go swim or canoe in that lake!</h4>
